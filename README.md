# _IUT
This repository contains all the courseworks (actually, ones I could get my hands on) during my undergraduate study at Isfahan University of Technology

Each course is provided with a readme file to further explain the materials available (not yet tho).

Use at own risk as some of the answers may be flawed.

If require further information for some of the contents, feel free to contact me!
